Simple Shell
=======
This is a proyect final semester for students of Holberton where we explore, understand and build a working functional simple shell program.
A shell is the user interface to communicate with the operative system service with of called bash scripting

Requirements:

Compile with GCC
holberton.h - The header file
shell.c - It's the main code
_strcmp.c - Code that compare strings
ctrlc.c - Code that not exit the program
exit.c - Exit function

Compile:
gcc -g -Wall -Werror -pedantic *.c -o shell --debug

Running:
./shell

This shell only run with the follow simple commands:

Example:
$ /bin/ls
List the files

$ /bin/pwd
Display the path folder

$ exit
Exit of the program and you can press CTRL + d to exit

$ ./shell: Finish program

Audience
=======
This Proyect is intended for engineers and computer science enthusiasts looking to learn basic source code that supports implementation of a shell program.

Environment
=======
Simple Shell was built and tested in the Ubuntu 14.04.6 LTS (GNU/Linux 3.13.0-170-generic x86_64)
